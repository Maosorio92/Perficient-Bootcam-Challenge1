# Perficient-Bootcamp-Challenge1
This is a challenge about testing https://petstore.swagger.io/v2 API. 
Here, you can find three main test.
First one is about verifying we get Status 200 and the pet is now available
Second one is about verifying we are getting the expected pet, the one we created at first.
Third one is about verifying we are getting the expected order, checking petId
